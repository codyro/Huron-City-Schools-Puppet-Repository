#Just testing Gollum.  

Why do I want to do that?
1. It's easy to install
2. It's easy to run
3. Why are these all number 1?

Note that if you want code with color, you need to install Pygments with the following command:
```sh
  bash-3.2#: easy_install Pygments
```


##Testing some Markdown:

```ruby
  def foo
    puts 'bar'
  end
```


```python
  def FlushCache():
    command = [_DSCACHEUTIL, '-flushcache']
    subprocess.call(command)
```

Rockin.
