#Just testing Gollum.  

Why do I want to do that?
1. It's easy to install
2. It's easy to run
3. Why are these all number 1?

##Testing some Markdown:

```python
  def FlushCache():
    """Flushes the DirectoryService cache."""
    command = [_DSCACHEUTIL, '-flushcache']
    subprocess.call(command)
```

Rockin.
